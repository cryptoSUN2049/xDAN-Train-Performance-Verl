"""Evaluation mode ``webdev_eval_v1``: render in the pod, one vision call, absolute score.

    score = (visual + query_fulfillment + premium_assets) / 3

This is the **evaluation** reward path, not a training one. It runs as verl's rollout-only
mode -- ``trainer.val_only=True`` AND ``trainer.val_before_train=True``, both required -- and
the number lands in the validation reward mean. The rubric and the reasoning behind its three
terms are in ``eval_rubric.py``.

**Why evaluation cannot reuse the training grader.** Training's ``design_group_v1`` ships the
workspace to the grading service, which returns a group-relative rank. A relative rank has no
absolute meaning for a single arm and is not comparable across arms, so it cannot evaluate.
This path therefore renders the site itself (``shot.py``, playwright inside the pod) and calls
the judge itself (``_llm_client.py``, any OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint). The cost is a
second rendering implementation; what it buys is an evaluation that does not need the grading
service to be running, which matters because evaluation is usually done where it is not.

**Three behaviours to know before reading a number out of this:**

1. **A render failure is not a bad page.** ``render_failed`` / ``screenshot_empty`` /
   ``render_env_failed`` return ``reward=None`` so the caller MASKS the trajectory instead of
   averaging a 0 into the result. Counting infra failures as zeros misreads the mean
   outright: one measured run had 57.9% judge failures and reported 0.351 for an arm whose
   real mean was 0.677 -- which reversed the conclusion.
2. **A judge failure returns None** for the same reason. Only "the judge answered and the
   page is genuinely poor" is a 0.
3. **The judge rejects oversized screenshots permanently** -- 23.0 MP was accepted and
   46.5 MP refused, and retrying does not help -- so every shot is scaled proportionally at
   ``MAX_MEGAPIXELS`` before being sent. Deliberately NOT resized to a fixed width: a page
   that overflows horizontally has a width that is itself the defect ``layout_integrity``
   exists to catch, and normalising it would hide the fault on the page's behalf.
